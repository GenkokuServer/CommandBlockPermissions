checkOps: true
# Check permissions of ops as command blocks will execute
# with a higher permission level than they would themselves

usePlayerPermissions: false
# Allow players the usage of commands for which they already
# have the permissions to. This can cause issues with some
# plugins as they check additional permissions in their command
# resolver which this plugin can't check for.

# to certain commands in command blocks!
